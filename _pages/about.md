Howdy!  
My name is Kalen Cole (Kalen) Jaroszewski, and I'm a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for mechanical design. I expect to graduate in May 2027 from Texas A&M University with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. Outside of the classroom, I serve as the Development Vice-President of the  largest project-based engineering organization at Texas A&M, TURTLE Robotics. My most notable accomplishment is transforming the [Hatchling Development Program](https://turtlerobotics.org/hatchling) from a 15 person per semester makerspace into a 200 person per semester multi-university program in three semesters. My project experiences currently include leading the design process of two quadruped robots,  magnetic gearbox research,  TMS design on a proposed ISS mission, avionics on a hybrid sounding rocket, and leading a First Tech Challenge team to second in the world.

Please look around in [projects](/portfolio). 

Note: This site is still under development, and I will be making frequent changes to fill in some of my past projects.
