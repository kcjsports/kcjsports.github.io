## Hatchling
As a Vice President of TURTLE Robotics, I’ve led the [Hatchling Development Program](https://turtlerobotics.org/hatchling) — a beginner-friendly introduction to engineering and leadership. Since assuming responsibility in my sophomore year, the program has grown from 16 to over 200 members every semester, spanning three student organizations at Texas A&M and Texas A&M Galveston.
Even with the impressive participation and technical success, my largest impact is on the community. Despite being packed into an undersized room, members collaborate and discover that engineering can be both challenging and deeply fulfilling. Today, 80% of the 20 interorganizational Hatchling leaders and half of the TURTLE officers are Hatchling alumni. A result that reflects more than the program growth, but an indicator that the countless hours I’ve dedicated to improving the program are not only enhancing engineering quality today but also providing a sustainable avenue for excellence and selfless leaders long after I graduate.

## Workshop Series
A bi-weekly platform for members to gain presentation experience and learn new technical and leadership skills

## Software Incubator
Releasing in the fall of 2026, Software Incubator is a sequel to Hatchling, focused on applying kinematics, sensor fusion, and classical control theory in robotics.

## Mechanical Incubator
Releasing in the fall of 2026, Mechanical Incubator is a sequel to Hatchling, focused on applying Ansys FEA, GD&T, and hardware selection in robotics

## Hatchling Controller

Featuring 6 face buttons, four bumpers/triggers, two joysticks, and OLED screen, the Hatchling controller uses the ESP-Now communication protocol to individual connect to over 20 Hatchling projects a semester. As lead designer and project manager, the controller has gone through two competition tested iterations. Extensive documentation on usage and assembly has been created to ensure the Galveston Hatchling Chapter has all the resources necessary to independently use the controller.

## Hatchling Trophies

Hatchling Cup: Takes design inspiration from the NBA Cup and Stanley Cup to recognize the winners of the bi-annual College Station Hatchling Competition. The modular base structure allows the addition of new winner plaques after the initial base fills up.
Hatchling Director Memento: Takes inspiration from the Hatchling Winner Trophy and is given to the students leaders who make Hatchling possible
Hatchling Winner Trophy: A small keeps sake to recognize the winners of the bi-annual College Station Hatchling Competition

## My Contributions

**Spring 2026**  
- Engaging 200+ undergraduate engineers through Hatchling, while coordinating 20 inter-organizational leaders and
the curriculum spanning technical, project management, and leadership skills  
- Pitching a College Station alliance that will provide hundreds of engineering students free access to student
organization workshops  
- Leading the development of two Hatchling Sequel programs (Mechanical and Software Incubator) that will continue
to foster hands-on learning and leadership growth in more specialized topics starting in Fall 2026  

**Fall 2025**  
- Successfully pitched and oversaw the expansion of Hatchling to Texas A&M organization, SOMTECH, and Texas
A&M Galveston organization, TART, providing 80 additional members access to the program  
- Primary speaker for a 200-member Hatchling semester cohort and coordinated the 17 interorganizational leaders  
- Published Hatchling online to expand access for 132 undergraduates unable to participate due to space limitations  
- Introduced the TURTLE Workshop Series to provide a platform for TURTLE’s 320+ members to gain public  
speaking experience and/or learn new technical and leadership skills.  
- Organized two collaboration workshops with WIRED and SOMTECH  
- Met with several organizations, including IGNITORS (1st year), Aggies Create, WIRED (1st year), and AggieSat
as a consultant to their mentorship programs  
- Implemented an organizational-wide procurement process, reducing lead time by a week for the 21 project teams  

**Spring 2025**  
- Spearheaded the Hatchling overhaul, resulting in:  
  - Implementation of new curriculum, seeing a threefold increase in retention to 75%  
  - 95% recommend the program to others, with 70% of participants entering without prior engineering experience  
  - Increased project completion rate sixfold to 60%  
  - Reduced introductory program spending and achieved net-positive operations under a $1,400 budget constraint  
  - Creation of documentation and internal operations restructuring for long-term sustainability  
- Primary speaker for a 100-member Hatchling semester cohort and coordinated the 8 Hatchling leaders  
- Designed trophies to recognize the efforts made by Hatchling leaders and members  

**Fall 2024**  
- Primary speaker for a 95-member Hatchling semester cohort and coordinated the 3 Hatchling leaders  
- Pitched Hatchling restructuring to better align with the original mission statement and Aggie Values
