Fire in the Hole was a project for [IGNITORS Rocketry](https://ignitorsrocketry.org/), a student rocketry org at Texas A&M, with the aim of producing a rocket for the International Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC). I joined the project as a founding member of the avionics team, where I was responsible for the in-flight video system. Unfortunately he in-flight video system was one of several elements removed from the IREC rocket in an effort to meet IREC timeline. I also played a critical role throughout the manufacturing /assembly of the rocket/rocket components.

## Fire in the Hole: November 2024 - May 2025

Fire In The Hole was the first launch vehicle designed and built by Ignitors Rocketry for 2025 IREC. Developed in a five month window, the rocket featured a contrail M711 hybrid motor and a fully student Student Researched and Developed (SRAD) tracking and telemetry system. Due to ground station issues, the rocket was unable to launch from the launch pad within the launch window.

Responsibilities:  
- Design, program, and integrate an in-flight video system into the avionics bay  

Individual Contributions:  
- Produced a 360◦ field of view camera department featuring 3 ESP-CAMs and a MicroSD card breakout board  
- Programmed a prelaunch startup sequence that sent a "start up" message from the flight controller to the 3 ESP-CAMS using ESP-NOW. This prevents the ESP-CAMs from overheating during launch delays  
- Validated schematics for an ESP32 flight controller featuring SparkFun commercial off the shelf (COTS) peripherals via the Qwiic I2C Protocol  
- Operated a CO2 Laser Cutter to manufacture the bulkheads, centering rings, and fins
- 3d-printed the avionics bay and camera department in ABS
